              <h3>About Us</h3>
              <p className="text-md-left">The Beginner Stock Trading Resource was created for our senior project at the University of Florida. We created this website to assist beginner stock traders who are interested in learning how to trade on the stock market. Our group is split up into two teamâ€™s; frontend and backend. On our frontend development team we have Jose Quintas and Joshua Morin. Our backend development team has Stephen Lu, Benjamin Berline, and Jacob Meisenheimer. We gained a great deal of knowledge and had a lot of fun creating this project. We hope you enjoy using it as much as we do.</p>
